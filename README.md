   - Calculated the average occupancy rates for each city to identify high and low-demand areas.

3. **Better occupancy, Weekday or Weekend:**
   - Compared occupancy rates between weekdays and weekends to determine the peak periods.

4. **Occupancy for different cities in the month of June:**
   - Examined the occupancy rates for various cities specifically in the month of June.

5. **Append new data with existing data in the month of August:**
   - Integrated new data from August with the existing dataset for a comprehensive analysis.

6. **Print revenue realized per city:**
   - Calculated the total revenue generated in each city.

7. **Print month by month revenue:**
   - Provided a month-by-month breakdown of revenue to track performance over time.

8. **Print revenue realized per hotel type:**
   - Analyzed revenue based on different types of hotels within the AtliQ Hotels chain.

9. **Print average rating per city:**
   - Computed the average customer ratings for hotels in each city.

10. **Print a pie chart of revenue realized per booking platform:**
    - Visualized the revenue distribution across various booking platforms using a pie chart.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Importing:**
   - Imported data from various sources to initiate the analysis.

2. **Data Exploration:**

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Performed thorough data cleaning to handle missing values, correct inconsistencies, and prepare the data for analysis.

4. **Data Transformation:**
   - Transformed the data into a suitable format for addressing the ad-hoc requests.

5. **Insight Generation:**
   - Addressed each ad-hoc request by generating insights and visualizations to support data-driven decision-making.
